# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales Analysis – Python Project Summary
### 🎯 Objectives of this project

* Analyzed 9,994 Superstore transactions (2014–2017) to evaluate sales, profit, and customer segment performance.
* Built time-based, category-based, and profitability insights using Pandas.
* Generated visual dashboards to identify growth trends and peak performance periods.

### 📈 Key Findings & Trends
* Strong seasonal spike in Q4 (Oct–Dec) across all years.
* Sales increased steadily from 2014 → 2017, showing growth trend.
* High sales do not always mean high profit (Furniture margins lower).
* Consumer segment contributes the highest revenue (~50%).

### 🛠 Tools & Methods Used
→ **Libraries :** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Calendar  
→ **Techniques :** GroupBy aggregation, time-series analysis, profit margin formula, ratio analysis  
→ **Visualization :** Multi-bar charts, labeled charts, saved business-ready PNG reports  
→ **Metrics Used :** Total Sales, Profit, Monthly Growth, Category Ranking, Segment Margin.

### 📊 Statistical Results

→ **Total Sales :** ≈ ₹2.29M | Total Profit: ≈ ₹286K | Avg Profit Margin: ~12.5%

→ **Top Category :** Technology (~36% of total sales) | Top Sub-Category: Phones

#### Most Profitable Sub-Category : Copiers 
#### Least Profitable : Tables

### 🏆 Achievements
