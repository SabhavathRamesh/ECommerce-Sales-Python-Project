##  🛒 E-Commerce Sales Analysis – Python Project Summary
### 🎯 Objectives of this project

* Analyzed 9,994 Superstore transactions (2014–2017) to evaluate sales, profit, and customer segment performance.
* Built time-based, category-based, and profitability insights using Pandas.
* Generated visual dashboards to identify growth trends and peak performance periods.

### 📈 Key Findings & Trends
* Strong seasonal spike in Q4 (Oct–Dec) across all years.
* Sales increased steadily from 2014 → 2017, showing growth trend.
* High sales do not always mean high profit (Furniture margins lower).
* Consumer segment contributes the highest revenue (~50%).
